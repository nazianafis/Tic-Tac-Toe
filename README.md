# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game where each player takes turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with either of the two distinct symbols (Xs and Os). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

#### In this repository, I've implemented the game of Tic-Tac-Toe via multiple approaches.

<br>

| S.no. | APPROACH      | CODE  |
|------:|---------------|-------|
| 1.    | MinMax, CLI  | [Link](https://github.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/ttt_mm.ipynb) |
| 2.    | GUI, two player | [Link](https://github.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/ttt_gui.py), [Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toe/main/ttt_gui.mp4) |
| 3.    | Reinforcement Learning, CLI | [Link](https://github.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/ttt_rl.ipynb) |
| 4.    | Reinforcement Learning, GUI | [Link](https://github.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/ttt_gui_rl.py), [Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toe/main/ttt_gui_rl.mp4) |

### To run the GUI version of Tic-Tac-Toe program with Reinforcement Learning: 

1. Clone the repository and move to the downloaded folder:
``` 
    $  git clone https://github.com/nazianafis/Tic-Tac-Toes
```

```
    $  cd Tic-Tac-Toes
```

2. Run `ttt_gui_rl.py`:
```
    $ python ttt_gui_rl.py
```

3. Wait for the agent to train and its policy to save and load.

4. The PyGame window will open up. Enjoy the gameplay!
