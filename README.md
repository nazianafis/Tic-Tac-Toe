# Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game where each player takes turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with either of the two distinct symbols (Xs and Os). The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

When considering only the state of the board, and after taking into account board symmetries (i.e. rotations and reflections), there are only 138 terminal board positions. A combinatorics study of the game shows that when "X" makes the first move, every time the game outcomes are as follows: 91 distinct positions are won by (X), 44 distinct positions are won by (O), and 03 distinct positions are drawn.


### In this repository, I will be implementing the game of Tic Tac Toe through multiple approaches.
